inclub
======

The syntax form `inclub` is a convenience substitute for `include` for use
in multi-file projects.  When the program may be run either interpreted or
compiled, and may be executed from outside its directory, possibly through
a symlink, inclub handles the details of making sure the "inclubbed" files
get loaded as intended.

In compiled code, inclub simply expands to include, meaning the inclubbed
file will be compiled into the binary.

In interpreted code, inclub resolves any symlinks back to the directory
the program resides in, and calls `load` on the inclubbed file in that
directory.

To use inclub, to load a file called "myfile.scm":

    (use inclub)
    (inclub "myfile")

If myfile.scm contains a module called `myfile`, add this:

    (import myfile)

If multiple files within the project need to import this module, it should
be inclubbed only once, in the main file.  The other files can then import
the module.

Thanks to Zbigniew for working out the basic mechanism, and also for
proposing the name "inclub".  inclub: the brute force include.
